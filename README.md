# hand-tracking-self-checkout
 Using the Leap Motion to create a prototype supermarket self checkout that doesn't require a user to touch a screen, helping to reduce the spread of germs through the touchscreen of the self checkout. 
 
 Intitially developed as part of the Ultraleap beyond touchscreens competition, this project is a prototype self checkout that allows the user to:
  - "Scan in" items to be on the shopping list
  - Simulates a staff member approving/ denying age restricted products
  - Add a loose item such as a granny smith apple to the basket 
  - Select payment type
  
  Feel free to use the code in any way you like
